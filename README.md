# Music Forecaster
Music Forecaster is a music tracking application that allows users to search for and follow their favorite bands and to see all upcoming albums as soon as a new album is announced. The application uses log-ins to give each user a custom ‘Radar’ page to view their artists. Music Forecaster also shows users a list of albums released today throughout the world.
